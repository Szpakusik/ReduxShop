# Z-Dowozem.com ( frontend )

In times of pandemic, it wasn't easy to buy daily products. People had to handle stress, whenever they were doing shopping.
We wanted to fill the gap in local market by developing online shop that offers delivery within 2 hours since order was created.
( In range of Morawica borough. )

Shop is ready for customers. Everything is available to use including sandbox payment with payu and mails with nodemailer.
